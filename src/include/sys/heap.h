/**
* \ingroup heap
* \file heap.h
* Implementation details:
* - Heap starts at virtual address HEAP_START and grows towards higher
* addresses.
*  - 256 MG of virtual memory is reserved to the kernel heap, but physical
*  blocks are allocated as they are needed.
* - Heap is initialized with one frame of memory (4 KB)
*   - Must call heap_init on startup
* - LLMalloc is a doubly linked list containing all the blocks, both available
* and used.
* - To allocate data, use heap_malloc
*   - This tries to find the FIRST available block with the given size.
*   - If no space exist, it will result in PANIC
* - Magic values
*   - 3B is used for magic values, this is only to prevent accidents, not
*   tampering.

* \test Simple correct usage test cases are performed:
* - Simple alloc at correct address
* - Address is available to write to
* - Allocate over more than 1 4 KB block
* - Dealloc and same realloc gives back correct address
*  - Also checks possible off-by-one error

* \todo
* - Need to be able to allocate blocks larger than 4 KB.
*  - Must also ensure that any size can be allocated, need a function to
*  allocate arbitrary sizes.
* - Handle possible alignment issues
* - Describe new algo
* - New tests:
*  - Free both and allocate 1 larger than the first, check that it's now one
*  block
